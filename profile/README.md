Tired of incomprehensible and unmaintainable YAML configurations?  
Sick of fragile CI/CD pipelines that break silently and require tribal knowledge to fix?  
Frustrated with “push and pray” commits just to test a single change?

Modern software delivery deserves better.

---

You write clean code, ship features fast, and obsess over developer experience—so why are your pipelines stuck in the past?

Traditional CI/CD tools lock you into static DSLs and inflexible GUIs.
<br/>
Testing changes locally? Forget it. Want to reuse logic across projects? Good luck.  
And every time something breaks, you’re digging through logs wondering why your deployment went sideways *again*.

**Catalyze** changes that.

It gives you pipelines as code—TypeScript-first, with strong typing, behavior tests, and full local execution.  
Swap integrations as easily as building with Lego blocks. Run your own server or don’t.  
And it doesn't care **where you deploy**—whether your stack runs in the **cloud** or **on-premise**, it works with Catalyze.

No YAML spaghetti. No CI guesswork. Just fast, testable, and composable delivery pipelines built like modern software.
